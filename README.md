# L-HELP

***This project is a solution provided to meet the rising labour requirement for the customers and also provide transparency for both labours and the customers to make sure that labourers are paid according to the standards defined by the government(based on the amount of time they work and the wages to be paid per hour for their work) and make sure that they are not exploited in any way by their employers***
